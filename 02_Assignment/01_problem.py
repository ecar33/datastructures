'''
Lists, Stacks, and Queues
1. (Hint: binary search) For a given sorted list (ascending order) and a target number, find the
first index of this number in O(log n) time complexity. If the target number does not exist in the
list, return -1.
Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10]ï¼Œ3
Output: 2
Explanation:
the first index of 3 is 2.
